                <p>In the 1991–1992 school year, Quirinus Quirrell taught mainly theoretical knowledge, 
                    which, four years later, the Ministry deemed he was the only teacher before Dolores Umbridge 
                    to be of acceptable standards. However, the Ministry at the time was corrupt and paranoid, 
                    thus their evaluation of Quirrell's effectiveness was inaccurate. In fact, while he was a studious intellectual,
                     his practical aspect was severely hampered by his timid and stuttering nature, leading him unable to teach properly,
                      which caused many students consider his classes to be a joke, and failed to take him seriously. </p>

                <p>In the 1992–1993 school year, Gilderoy Lockhart, fraudulent and incompetent, taught nothing to the classes 
                of his respective tenure, aside from nonsensical and unrelated materials, considering that he was hired solely
                by Albus Dumbledore for the purpose of ousting him as a fraud to the world. His lectures were simply storytelling 
                and theatrical re-enactments from his books, since his first practical lesson ended in a disaster that he failed to contain
                (involving live "freshly caught" Cornish Pixies), and his idea of homework was for the class to compose a poem of one of 
                his alleged achievements with the offer of a signed copy of his autobiography to the best composer.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lockhart simply using the course to promote his uninformative publications, Ron Weasley claimed that the only thing 
                    he learned from it was "not to set pixies loose", and expressed his desire to drop out of the course mainly of Lockhart's
                    incompetence. In late 1992, Lockhart also established a very shortly lived and unsuccessful Duelling Club with the help 
                    of Severus Snape, in an attempt to teach students how to defend themselves; the club only had one meeting which resulted 
                    in complete chaos.

                <p>In the 1993–1994 school year, Professor Lupin was among the most effective teachers to have taught, 
                    as many students under his tutelage agreed upon. He taught practical aspects during the lectures, 
                    even bringing in several dark creatures in captivity as visual aids, and assigned theoretical aspects
                    for homework.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    He was also charismatic, earning the respect of his students, and therefore, making them want to learn from him. 
                    Lupin also gave his favourite student Harry Potter additional lessons in how to perform the Patronus Charm, so he
                    could learn to combat Dementors. Hermione Granger claimed he was the only teacher among their five (at the time)
                    who knew what he was doing.

                    In the 1994–1995 school year, Bartemius Crouch Junior, then disguised as Alastor Moody using Polyjuice Potion, 
                believed firmly in a practical approach. As such, he taught the fourth-year class on the Unforgivable Curses
                that were normally reserved for the sixth year, believing they need to see it sooner. He even performed the 
                Imperius Curse on all the students as a means to teach them how to resist it. Although the students found him
                to be one of the most effective instructors (despite his true identity later being revealed to be a criminal), 
                the Ministry found the lessons to be very controversial, and expressed their strong disapproval.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the 1995–1996 school year, the Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge, had deluded himself with the bizarre
                    conspiracy theory that Headmaster Albus Dumbledore was using the students to create a private army of young 
                    witches and wizards to overthrow the Ministry. As such, he implanted Dolores Umbridge to become the teacher 
                    of the Defence Against the Dark Arts classes, which he believed to be the main source of training (e.g. defensive spells)
                    for Dumbledore's would-be soldiers.

                <p>
                Umbridge supplied a syllabus based entirely on the theory of conflict rather facing them, all of which was simply 
                reading out of the textbook, believing that this would be sufficient in passing the examinations. Furthermore, she 
                herself did not teach the students, as she had them read the textbooks quietly in class and refused to answer their 
                questions any more than to silence them. 
                </p>
                <p>
                This misguided belief deprived the students on any useful lessons as even the theories are inaccurate, thus leading 
                to the formation on Dumbledore's Army, which taught more practical defence that students from all grades found more useful. 
                Umbridge would later claim that the spells Harry taught were deemed by the Ministry inappropriate for students at their ages.

                <p>
                In the 1996–1997 school year, Professor Snape taught his classes to respect the Dark Arts as a dangerous and ever-evolving 
                opponent, and that their defences must be as versatile as the foul arts they seek to undo. He imposed a darker atmosphere 
                in the classroom by dimmer lighting and macabre portraits in order to allow the students to have a firmer understanding of 
                the sufferings the Dark Arts can bring. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Hermione concluded that Snape's ideals were very much the same as what Harry Potter expressed during the Dumbledore's Army
                recruitment meeting: not simply memorising a bunch of spells, but to understand and react appropriately to the situation at hand.
                As with Lupin and Crouch, Snape taught practically during the lectures, and assigned theories for homework. Contrarily to his
                previous position as Potions Master, Snape taught Defence fairer, with a sense of passion he did not show in Potions.
                As with every other course that required practical spells, sixth-years were taught nonverbal spell usage, and were expected
                to use them in class from then on.
